# Description
This is a Node JS Script that connected to an API and downloads crawls through specific pages

Nodejs was used here as it was much easier to handle USPS API in a scripted fashion.
Kettle was used as a final handling for the files as it was much simpler to handle 
the SQL logic and API calls to handle the mail returns, then to program it in Nodejs.
